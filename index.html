I was fortunate enough to join Sequoia Capital in 1989 upon my graduation from graduate business school. It was very stimulating to finance entrepreneurs who wanted to change the world.

The first option would inhibit our children’s dreams and motivations; the second option is very inefficient; the third option is not part of our DNA.

More recently, we have extended our support to other areas including health care research (cancer and neurologic diseases), local health care delivery, the environment and community organizations. Over time, our philanthropic aperture will likely widen and, simultaneously, will deepen in a few areas that we feel especially passionate about. We hope that as our children reach adulthood that they will join us in our family’s philanthropic mission.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="9" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="173"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="174"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="175"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="176"><span data-reactid="177"><!-- react-empty: 178 --><h2 data-reactid="179"><a data-reactid="180">S-Cubed Cap</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="181"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="182"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="183"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="184"></div></section></div></div>
