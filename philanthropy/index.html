Over time, our philanthropic aperture will likely widen and, simultaneously, will deepen in a few areas that we feel especially passionate about. We hope that as our children reach adulthood that they will join us in our family’s philanthropic mission."}]},"site-footer-item":{"id":"site-footer-item","index":2,"metadata":{"@type":"footer","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"site-footer-block","type":"footer","html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"footer":{"rss":{"href":"rss.xml","rel":"alternate","title":"ScubedCap RSS","type":"application/rss+xml"}}}]}},"sections":[{"componentId":"ArticleFallback","itemsToRenderIds":["2c05224d-1be8-4223-a456-7f0b2efcc220"],"contracts":{"the-beautician":{"$item_index":1,"sectionsBeautyverse":{"section-height":{"$class":["section-height-fullscreen"]},"text-align":{"$class":["text-align-center"]},"group-order":{"$class":["group-order-normal"]},"group-graphical-shape":{"$class":["group-graphical-shape-none"]}},"$class":["group-graphical-shape-none","group-order-normal","text-align-center","section-height-fullscreen","site:w-multiple-item","hero-transition-none","section-v-padding-medium","section-h-padding-large","Neuburg","2c05224d-1be8-4223-a456-7f0b2efcc220","item:dont-cover-filter","item:dont-cover-crop","item:dont-cover-overlay","item:w-cover-saliency","item:w-cover-landscape","item:w-cover-high-res","item:w-cover-full-mobile-res","item:w-cover-full-desktop-res","ArticleFallback"]},"the-colorist":{"$item_index":1,"colorverse":{"colors-solution":{"$class":["colors-black"]},"colors-locality":{"$class":["colors-global"]}},"$class":["colors-global","colors-black","site:colors-global","site:colors-dark"],"colorsSolution":{"isLight":false,"isDark":true,"lightnessClass":"is-dark","base":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"bg":{"r":3,"g":3,"b":3},"box":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"boxShadow":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.3},"boxPop":{"r":207,"g":39,"b":48},"boxPopText":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255},"boxPop2":{"r":69,"g":174,"b":78},"boxPop2Text":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"boxPopTextHover":{"r":204,"g":204,"b":204},"boxPop2TextHover":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"boxPopMostVibrant":{"r":54,"g":226,"b":69},"boxPopMostVibrantText":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"selectionText":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255},"selection":{"r":226,"g":54,"b":97,"a":0.5},"header":{"r":1,"g":1,"b":1},"zebraStripe":{"r":4,"g":4,"b":4},"line":{"r":19,"g":19,"b":19},"mediaBorder":{"css":"1px solid hsl(0, 0%, 7%)","width":1,"type":"solid","color":{"r":19,"g":19,"b":19}},"mediaShadowColor":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.4},"mediaInsetColor":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255,"a":0.1},"mediaShadows":[{"css":"0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)","x":0,"y":1,"blur":2,"color":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.4},"inset":false},{"css":"inset 0 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)","x":0,"y":1,"blur":1,"color":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255,"a":0.1},"inset":true}],"title":{"r":219,"g":240,"b":220},"title2":{"r":153,"g":168,"b":154},"subTitle":{"r":73,"g":73,"b":73},"text":{"r":243,"g":241,"b":242},"text2":{"r":170,"g":169,"b":169},"textShadow":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.5},"textShadowProps":{"color":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.5},"x":0,"y":1,"blur":0},"textPop":{"r":104,"g":135,"b":226},"textPop2":{"r":215,"g":76,"b":83},"meta":{"r":73,"g":73,"b":73},"metaHover":{"r":84,"g":84,"b":84},"icon":{"r":104,"g":135,"b":226},"iconSelected":{"r":104,"g":135,"b":226},"iconOver":{"r":104,"g":135,"b":226},"palette":[{"r":68,"g":106,"b":219},{"r":69,"g":174,"b":78},{"r":207,"g":39,"b":48},{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255},{"r":35,"g":31,"b":32}]}},"the-lensman":{"filter":{"$class":["passthrough"],"graph":"passthrough","config":null}},"itemsClasses":["2c05224d-1be8-4223-a456-7f0b2efcc220","item:dont-cover-filter","item:dont-cover-crop","item:dont-cover-overlay","item:w-cover-saliency","item:w-cover-landscape","item:w-cover-high-res","item:w-cover-full-mobile-res","item:w-cover-full-desktop-res"],"siteClasses":["site:w-multiple-item","hero-transition-none","section-v-padding-medium","section-h-padding-large","Neuburg","site:colors-global","site:colors-dark"],"componentClasses":["ArticleFallback"]},"sectionIndex":0}],"contracts":{"the-typographer":{"typography":{"fonts":{"display":{"normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.09090909090909094,"$type":["sans","grotesque"],"$caps":"normal","foundry":"google","family":"Roboto","name":"Roboto","license":"apache","tags":["sans serif"],"description":"Roboto is an open-source, grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Robertson in 2011 and released through Google.
