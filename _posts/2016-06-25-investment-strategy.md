S-Cubed Capital manages a globally diversified investment portfolio with the goal of achieving superior, long term, risk-adjusted returns.

The investment portfolio participates in a variety of asset classes: public global equities, fixed income, absolute return, private equity, and real assets. The relative weighting towards each asset class is reviewed on a consistent basis and is adjusted as required to meet long term return objectives.

S-Cubed Capital invests its own capital and does not operate like a conventional fund that has outside limited partners. We will make direct equity investments in privately-held companies across a variety of industry sectors and in attractive real estate opportunities. We prefer to invest alongside other experienced private investors and top-tier institutional investors.
